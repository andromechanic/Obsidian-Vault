### Datasets for [[Fine-tuning]]

Concept: The quality and quantity of the fine-tuning dataset are paramount to the success of the fine-tuning process. The dataset should be carefully curated to reflect the target task and desired output format.

Key Considerations:

- Quality: Data should be clean, accurate, and relevant. Remove noisy, irrelevant, or biased samples.
    
- Quantity: While fine-tuning requires less data than pre-training, sufficient examples are needed for the model to learn the new patterns. The "right" amount varies by task and model size, but typically ranges from hundreds to thousands of examples.
    
- Format: The data must be formatted correctly for the specific task (e.g., prompt-response pairs for conversational agents, input-summary pairs for summarization).
    
- Diversity: The dataset should cover a diverse range of inputs and expected outputs within the task domain to ensure generalization.
    
- Bias: Be mindful of potential biases in the dataset, as the model will learn and amplify them.
    
- Synthetic Data Generation: For tasks with limited real-world data, techniques like prompting a larger LLM to generate synthetic data can be explored, though care must be taken to ensure quality.
    
- Instruct-tuning datasets: For conversational or instruction-following tasks, datasets often consist of instruction-response pairs (e.g., from platforms like Alpaca, Dolly, OpenAssistant).
    

### Evaluation Metrics for Fine-tuned LLMs

Concept: After fine-tuning, it's crucial to evaluate the model's performance on the target task using appropriate metrics.

Common Metrics (task-dependent):

- Perplexity: Measures how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity generally indicates a better language model. (More for general language modeling or text generation quality.)
    
- ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): Used for summarization and translation tasks, comparing the generated text to reference summaries.
    
- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): Primarily for machine translation, but can be adapted for other text generation tasks.
    
- F1-Score, Precision, Recall: For classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, named entity recognition).
    
- Human Evaluation: The gold standard for many generative tasks. Human annotators assess factors like coherence, fluency, relevance, and helpfulness.
    
- Specific Task Metrics: Depending on the application, custom metrics might be needed (e.g., code correctness for code generation, factual accuracy for knowledge-based QA).
    

Evaluation Protocols:

- Validation Set: Used during training to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
    
- Test Set: A completely held-out dataset used only once at the end to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's final performance.
    

### Hyperparameter Tuning for Fine-tuning

Concept: Fine-tuning involves setting several hyperparameters that significantly impact the training process and final model performance. Optimal hyperparameter values are typically found through experimentation.

Key Hyperparameters:

- Learning Rate: Crucial. Often much smaller than pre-training (e.g., 1e−5 to 1e−4) to avoid disrupting the pre-trained knowledge.
    
- Batch Size: Number of samples processed before updating model weights. Larger batches can lead to more stable gradients but require more memory.
    
- Number of Epochs: How many times the model sees the entire dataset. Fine-tuning usually requires fewer epochs than pre-training.
    
- Warmup Steps/Ratio: Gradually increases the learning rate from zero to its maximum value at the beginning of training, helping to stabilize optimization.
    
- Weight Decay: A regularization technique that penalizes large weights, preventing overfitting.
    
- LoRA Specific (if applicable):
    

- r (LoRA rank): The dimension of the low-rank matrices. Higher r means more trainable parameters but potentially better expressiveness.
    
- lora_alpha: A scaling factor for the LoRA updates, often set to 2*r or 16*r.
    
- target_modules: Which layers in the Transformer to apply LoRA to (e.g., query, key, value, output projection matrices).
    

### Overfitting and Underfitting in Fine-tuning

Concept: These are common issues in machine learning that also apply to fine-tuning.

- Overfitting: Occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and idiosyncrasies, leading to poor performance on unseen data.
    

- Signs: High performance on the training set, but significantly lower performance on the validation/test set.
    
- Mitigation: Early stopping (stop training when validation performance degrades), regularization (weight decay, dropout), data augmentation, using a larger and more diverse dataset.
    

- Underfitting: Occurs when the model is too simple or hasn't been trained sufficiently to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
    

- Signs: Low performance on both training and validation/test sets.
    
- Mitigation: Increase training epochs, increase model capacity (if using PEFT, increase LoRA rank), use a more complex model (if possible), ensure the learning rate is not too low.
    

###  Data Augmentation for LLM Fine-tuning

Concept: Data augmentation involves generating new training examples from existing ones to increase the diversity and size of the dataset. While less common than in computer vision, it's gaining traction for LLMs to improve generalization and robustness.

Techniques:

- Paraphrasing: Using another LLM or a rule-based system to rephrase existing prompts or responses.
    
- Back-translation: Translating text to another language and then back to the original language.
    
- Synonym Replacement: Replacing words with their synonyms.
    
- Adding Noise: Introducing slight perturbations like typos, omissions, or insertions.
    
- Prompt Expansion: Adding more context or variations to prompts.
    

###  Ethical Considerations and Bias in Fine-tuning

Concept: Fine-tuning does not inherently remove biases present in the base model or introduce in the fine-tuning data. It can even amplify existing biases or introduce new ones if the fine-tuning data is unrepresentative or biased.

Key Considerations:

- Data Bias: Scrutinize your fine-tuning dataset for demographic, social, or historical biases.
    
- Harmful Generations: Models can learn to generate toxic, prejudiced, or unsafe content.
    
- Fairness: Ensure the fine-tuned model performs equitably across different demographic groups.
    
- Transparency: Understand the limitations and potential biases of your model.
    
- Mitigation Strategies:
    

- Curated Data: Use diverse and debiased datasets.
    
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): A powerful technique used to align models with human preferences and values, often explicitly targeting safety and helpfulness (as used in Llama 2 Chat).
    
- Guardrails: Implement external filtering or moderation layers to prevent harmful outputs.
    
- Bias Detection Tools: Use tools to identify and quantify bias in model outputs.
